PHP is a programming language that can do all sorts of things: evaluate form data sent from a browser, build custom web content to serve the browser, talk to a database, and even send and receive cookies .

The PHP code is written in the --<--?php echo"<";> ?php ?> tags. 
<script>
printf("<?php ?>");
</script>

Echo
You can think of echo as a PHP command: it tells PHP to echo back the information that follows. If you type

<?php echo "Hooray!"; ?>

PHP will dutifully print out "Hooray!"
